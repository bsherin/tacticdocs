The Module Viewer
=================

As explained in :doc:`the introduction to making tiles <Making-Tiles>`,
this is the tile editor that provides minimal scaffolds. It’s essentially
just a text editor for your tile code. The interface is hopefully
self-explanatory. But when writing your tiles you’ll want to refer
heavily to the relevant sections of this manual, particular the page on :doc:`Tile-Structure`.

If you’re the kind of person who likes to keep your hands on the
keyboard, you can consult the list of :doc:`Module-Viewer-Keyboard-Shortcuts`.
