These tiles are drawn from the tile <em>repository</em>.\nMore specifically, it includes all of the tiles from the repository that\nhave the tag \u201cdefault.\u201d</p>\n<p>Next, suppose you go to your tile library and click <strong>load</strong> to load a\ntile. Immediately, the tile menus in every open project window will be\nupdated to include the new tile. The new tile is available universally,\nacross all of your open projects.</p>\n<p>If you load a tile, and an existing tile has the same name, then the old\ntile will be overwritten. But note: The name of a tile comes from the\nname of the tile class, not the name of the module. It has to be this\nway since it\u2019s possible to have multiple tile classes inside a module.</p>\n<p>If you go to your tile library, and click <strong>unload</strong>, this will clear\nall of the tiles that you loaded.</p>\n<p>This has an impact on what happens if you <strong>save a project.</strong> By\ndefault, when you save a project, the project makes a note of all of the\ntiles that are open in the user environment. Then, if the project is\nloaded some time later, it will make sure that all of these tiles are\navailable in the user environment. If they are not, it will load them.\nNote that it finds the tiles by name in your library, it does not use a\nsaved version of the tile code.</p>\n<p>However, you can change this default behavior on a per-project basis.\nWhen you first save a project, you will get a dialog that looks like\nthis:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image0\" src=\"../_images/883c05a2.png\" /></p>\n<p>If you click the check box \u201cInclude only currently used tiles,\u201d then\nonly the tiles actually used in the current project will be included in\nthe list of tiles to be loaded whenever the project is loaed.</p>\n<p>Suppose you <strong>edit a previously loaded tile</strong> in the module viewer, then\nclick \u201csave and load.\u201d In that case, any new versions of this tile will\nhave the new version of the code. Existing tiles will not be modified.\nHowever if you click the refresh icon at the top right of a tile (just\nto the left of the trash can), then the tile will refresh itself using\nwhatever current version of the code is. When it does this, it will\nassume that the options and their values stay the same. If an edit to\nthe tile\u2019s code changed the options, then the refresh button will cause\nthe tile to display the options for you to edit before running the tile.</p>\n</div>\n", "alabaster_version": "0.7.10", "display_toc": false, "title": "Tile Availability", "sourcename": "Which-tiles-are-available-when.rst.txt", "customsidebar": null, "metatags": "", "current_page_name": "Which-tiles-are-available-when", "next": {"link": "../Making-Tiles/", "title": "Intro to the tools"}, "rellinks": [["genindex", "General Index", "I", "index"], ["Making-Tiles", "Intro to the tools", "N", "next"], ["Log-And-Notebook", "The Log and Notebook", "P", "previous"]], "meta": {}, "parents": [], "sidebars": ["about.html", "navigation.html", "relations.html", "searchbox.html", "donate.html"], "toc": "<ul>\n<li><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#\">Tile Availability</a></li>\n</ul>\n", "prev": {"link": "../Log-And-Notebook/", "title": "The Log and Notebook"}, "page_source_suffix": ".rst"}
