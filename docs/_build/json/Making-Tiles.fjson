Tactic tiles are represented as\npython classes. You can, if you want, write the files in the editor of\nyour choice and then upload them to your tactic resource library. But\nmost often you will use one of the online editors that are part of the\ntactic system. These online editors have special supports for writing\ntiles. The specifications for writing a tactic tile class are explained\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"Tile-Structure.html\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The first of the online editors is the <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"Module-Viewer.html\">Module\nViewer</a>. It presents a tile, in its raw form, as a\npython class. If you\u2019re an accomplished python programmer, and\ncomfortable with python classes, then you might want to use this editor.\nIn addition, even if you aren\u2019t comfortable with python classes, you\nmight have to use the Module Viewer to fix a tile that has been garbled\nby the second editor, which I will describe in the next paragraph.</p>\n<p>The second online editor is the <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"Tile-Creator.html\">Tile Creator</a>. It\u2019s\ndesigned to provide much more scaffolding for the construction of tiles.\nBe careful. If you do anything fancy in a tile created in the module\nviewer, there\u2019s a chance it will be lost if you resave the tile from the\nTile Creator.</p>\n</div>\n", "alabaster_version": "0.7.10", "display_toc": false, "title": "Intro to the tools", "sourcename": "Making-Tiles.rst.txt", "customsidebar": null, "metatags": "", "current_page_name": "Making-Tiles", "next": {"link": "../Tile-Creator/", "title": "The Tile Creator"}, "rellinks": [["genindex", "General Index", "I", "index"], ["Tile-Creator", "The Tile Creator", "N", "next"], ["Which-tiles-are-available-when", "Tile Availability", "P", "previous"]], "meta": {}, "parents": [], "sidebars": ["about.html", "navigation.html", "relations.html", "searchbox.html", "donate.html"], "toc": "<ul>\n<li><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#\">Intro to the tools</a></li>\n</ul>\n", "prev": {"link": "../Which-tiles-are-available-when/", "title": "Tile Availability"}, "page_source_suffix": ".rst"}
