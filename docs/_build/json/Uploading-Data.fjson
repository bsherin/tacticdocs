There are two modalities\navailable for datasets, \u201ctable\u201d and \u201cfreeform.\u201d Freeform datasets\nconsist of a set of unstructured text documents. Table datasets consist\nof a set of tables of data.</p>\n<p>To upload data, go to the collections tab of your user library. Click\n\u201cchoose files\u201d next to either the \u201cimport as_table\u201d or \u201cimport as\nfreeform\u201d buttons. Then select some files. <strong>Note: You can select any\nnumber of files and these files will be the \u201cdocuments\u201d in your new\n\u201ccollection.\u201d</strong></p>\n<p><img alt=\"image0\" src=\"../_images/e6a11be3.png\" /></p>\n<p>For table collectons, data must be in the form of xlsx, csv, tsv, or\nplain text (txt) files. The first row of an xlsx, csv, or tsv file must\ncontain the headers for the columns. Data in a txt file is treated as a\nseries of rows of text with rows separated by newlines.) If multiple\nfiles are selected, each of the files is treated as a separate document\nwithin the collection.
