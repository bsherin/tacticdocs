Getting Started
===============

Creating an account
------------------------------

First, you need an account. Right now the only way to get an account is to email
me, Bruce Sherin, at bsherin@u.northwestern.edu. In response, you'll get a username
and password.

Then head over to https://tactictext.net and use your credentials to log in.
After you do, you can click on your account name at the top right of your browser window
to edit your profile and change your password.

First steps with collections
----------------------------

After you log in, you'll be taken automatically to Library manager. To get started using tactic, you need to load in some
data. Your libary should already have some collections loaded. In the image below, the collections are the
resources with blue data cylinders. To view one of these collections, first select it.
:guilabel:`open` from the Open menu. (You can also double_click directly on the item or press the space bar or enter key.) A new pane
should appear showing your collection.

If you want, you can also explore additional sample collections
available in the repository, which provides resources that can be used
anyone.

Click :guilabel:`Repository` in the toolbar. This will allow you to see resources in the
repository.

Select one of the data collections from the list that appears. Then select
:guilabel:`Copy To Library` from the Transfer menu and the collection will
be added to your own personal
library.

Finally, close the browser tab showing the repository to go back to your own library.

Alternatively, you can `upload one of your own
datasets <Uploading-Data.html>`__

Also, before you try to do anything, you should head over to the “code”
tab of your resource library and make sure there are some tokenizers there.
If there aren’t, import some of the tokenizers from the repository.

Working with your collection
----------------------------

If you haven’t already loaded a collection, do that. Then head over to
the :doc:`Main-interface` section of the documentation.
