This is partly automatic and\npartly manual. First the manual part: In the Module Viewer and Tile\nCreator there is now a button that says **Checkpoint++. Clicking on of\nthis buttons saves the tile as usual. But it also will cause Tactic to\npermanently save a snapshot of the tile code as it appears at the moment\nof the save.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image0\" src=\"../_images/9c27d3dd.png\" /></p>\n<p>Tactic also tries to do some semi-intelligent saving of snapshots\nautomatically. Every time that a tile is saved, Tactic will save a\nsnapshot of the tile. However, this set of automatically generated\nsnapshots is regularly pruned in a particular way: Every time that a\ntile is opened in the Module Viewer or the Tile Creator, Tactic looks at\nall snapshots that are older than one day ago, and it only keeps the\nlast version of a tile that was saved on a given day. So you\u2019ll only end\nup with at most one snapshot of a tile per day. This pruning doesn\u2019t\naffect manually created snapshots.</p>\n<p>To access the history, you click the <strong>History</strong> button in one of the\ntile viewers This is what it looks like, in all it\u2019s glory.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image1\" src=\"../_images/history-viewer.png\" /></p>\n<p>The popup list at the top right allows you to browse through old\nversions of the tile. Differences are highlighted and you can copy code\nfrom old versions to the current tile. (You have to click Save for any\nchanges to be saved.)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"compare-tiles\">\n<h2>Compare Tiles<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#compare-tiles\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h2>\n<p>You can also compare two tiles. Clicking on the <strong>Compare</strong> button\nbrings up a window that is similar to the history viewer. It has a popup\non the right hand side that you can click to choose any tile from your\nlibrary to compare to the current tile.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n", "alabaster_version": "0.7.10", "display_toc": true, "title": "History and Compare", "sourcename": "Tile-Version-History-And-Compare.rst.txt", "customsidebar": null, "metatags": "", "current_page_name": "Tile-Version-History-And-Compare", "next": {"link": "../Tile-Structure/", "title": "Tile Structure"}, "rellinks": [["genindex", "General Index", "I", "index"], ["Tile-Structure", "Tile Structure", "N", "next"], ["Module-Viewer-Keyboard-Shortcuts", "Keyboard Shortcuts", "P", "previous"]], "meta": {}, "parents": [], "sidebars": ["about.html", "navigation.html", "relations.html", "searchbox.html", "donate.html"], "toc": "<ul>\n<li><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#\">History and Compare</a><ul>\n<li><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#version-history\">Version History</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#compare-tiles\">Compare Tiles</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n", "prev": {"link": "../Module-Viewer-Keyboard-Shortcuts/", "title": "Keyboard Shortcuts"}, "page_source_suffix": ".rst"}
