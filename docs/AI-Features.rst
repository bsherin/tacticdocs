AI Features
=================================

Creating an OpenAI API Key
--------------------------------

To use the AI features, you have to have a chatGPT key. Here's how you can get one:

Step 1: Create or Log In to Your OpenAI Account

- Go to the OpenAI API platform: https://platform.openai.com/
- Click **Sign Up** to create an account, or **Log In** if you already have one.

Step 2: Access the API Keys Page

- After logging in, click on your profile icon in the top-right corner.
- Choose **View API Keys** from the menu.

Step 3: Generate a New API Key

- Click the **+ Create new secret key** button.
- Give your key a name (e.g., ``My Copilot Key``).
- Click **Create secret key**.
- **Copy the key** immediately â€” you will not be able to see it again later.

Step 4: Set Up Billing

- Visit the billing page: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
- Add a payment method to activate your key.

Entering Your Key in Tactic
--------------------------------
To enter your key in Tactic, go to the account interface (see below) and enter it in the field labelled "OpenAI API Key".

There is also a setting to turn on and off live coding suggestions.

Using the AI Chatbot
----------------------
After entering your key, you can access the AI chatbot from the tab bar on the right of Tactic. You might need
to reresh the page to see the new tab.

To use the chatbot, click on the tab and enter your question in the text box.
Use control-enter to submit your question or click the send button next to the text box.
The chatbot will respond. (The first response might take a little while, but subsequent responses should be faster.)

Saving a Chat
----------------
If you log out from tactic or you are inactivate for a long stretch, your instance of the virtual assistant will
shut down and you'll lose your chat history. However you can save your chat history by clicking the save button. This
will turn your chat history into a tactic notebook in your library.

Using the AI Copilot
----------------------
The AI copilot is a tool that helps you write code. It is available in the tile creator and in notebooks. AI suggestions
will be included in the autocomplete list. Hitting :kbd:`option-/` at any point will show suggestions.
