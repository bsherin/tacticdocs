{"body": "<div class=\"section\" id=\"the-main-interface\">\n<h1>The Main Interface<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#the-main-interface\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h1>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"the-top-parts\">\n<h2>The top parts<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#the-top-parts\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h2>\n<p>The helpfully-titled \u201cMain\u201d interface is where you do the real work with\nTactic. It\u2019s what you see when you load a data collection or a project.\nThere is a menu bar at the top. The column menu can be used to hide\ncolumns, add new columns, or reorder columns. Note that hiding columns\ndoesn\u2019t delete them, and selecting \u201cunhide\u201d from the column menu will\nmake all hidden columns reappear. Hidden columns are also available to\ntiles.</p>\n<p>Use the Project menu to save the current state of a project. You can\nalso export the data table in a few different ways: (1) you can export\nit as a data collection back to your library, (2) you can export the\nvisible document as a CSV file on your local machine, and (3) you can\nexport all of the documents to an excel file.</p>\n<p>The Project menu also has a an option <strong>change_collection</strong> which lets\nyou swap out the data collection in the main data table.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image0\" src=\"../_images/20160929-094941.png\" /></p>\n<p>There are some useful buttons at the top of the panel that holds the\ntable. In the top-left corner is a button that shrinks the entire table\ndown to a single small icon. This gives you more space to work with\ntiles. There\u2019s also a popup for selecting which document will be\nvisible, and some search buttons.</p>\n<p>You can resize columns by clicking on the lines that separate them. You\ncan also change the area available for the table to display by clicking\nat the right edge of the table. This doesn\u2019t resize the table, it just\nhides part of it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"working-with-tiles\">\n<h2>Working with tiles<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#working-with-tiles\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h2>\n<p>The other menus at the top of the main interface allow you to created\nanalysis tiles. From the \u201cword\u201d menu, you can select the WordFreqDist\noption to create a tile.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image1\" src=\"../_images/20160929-095746.png\" /></p>\n<p>If you then click on the <strong>show/hide options</strong> button, you\u2019ll see the\noptions for this tile. Fill these in and click submit to run the tile.\nHint: If you don\u2019t see any choices in the tokenizer menu, go back to\nyour library, to the \u201ccode\u201d area, and copy some tokenizers from the\nrepository. Another hint: In the \u201clist\u201d area of you resource library,\nyou can also copy some additional word lists from the repository, as\nwell as create your own.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image2\" src=\"../_images/20160929-133108.png\" /></p>\n<p>There are also buttons at the top of a tile. Some of these need some\nexplanation. The <strong>show container log</strong> button displays, within the\ntile, the log of the docker container within which the tile runs. This\nwill show everything that is written to stderr or stdout. If you use a\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">print</span></code> statment the output will appear there. (It\u2019s unfortunate that\nthe word \u201clog\u201d means something different in this case.)</p>\n<p>The <strong>send to log</strong> button writes a version of the tiles contents to the\nlog, which is visible at the bottom of the main interface. This will be\njust a copy of the tile\u2019s html unless the programmer of the tile has\nimplemented an overriding method to write something different. (This is\nexplained in the part of the documentation on creating tiles.)</p>\n<p>The <strong>log parameters</strong> button displays, in the log at the bottom of the\nscreen, a table containing the values of the various options, as\nspecified on the back of the tile.</p>\n<p>The <strong>recreate from library</strong>, refreshes the tile, but it does so by\ngrabbing the current version of the code from the library. Then it\nreruns the tile, keeping the values of options the same. This is\nintended for the situation in which you are making changes to a tile\u2019s\ncode, and then wanting to rerun it to see the effects. There\u2019s a special\ncase: If the set of options has been changed, then the tile isn\u2019t rerun.\nInstead, the options panel is displayed so you can enter values for any\nnew options. Clicking submit at that point reruns the tile with the new\ncode.</p>\n<p>You can reposition tiles by clicking and dragging in the colored area at\nthe top. You can also resize tiles by clicking and dragging in the lower\nright-hand corner.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"the-log-in-brief\">\n<h2>The Log in brief<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#the-log-in-brief\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h2>\n<p>At the bottom of the main interface, on the left, is the log. The top of\nthe log looks like this. Nice, huh!</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image3\" src=\"../_images/e64e7678.png\" /></p>\n<p>As mentioned above, if you click the log button on a tile, then the tile\nwill send some sort of information to the log. That\u2019s useful for\ntracking what you\u2019re doing over time. The top of the Log has a button\nthe can be used to add an editable text field to the bottom of the\nconsole. Note that the content of the Log is saved when a project is\nsaved.</p>\n<p>You can also use the log something like a python notebook. There\u2019s more\nabout the the log and the standalone notebook\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"Log-And-Notebook.html\">here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"the-exports-viewer\">\n<h2>The Exports Viewer<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#the-exports-viewer\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h2>\n<p>At the bottom of the main interface, on the right, is the exports\nviewer. It is possibly the most useful thing in the entire universe. If\nyou have read about tiles, you\u2019ll recall that tiles can declare that\nsome of their variables are available for access by other tiles via\npipes. In order to figure out what\u2019s going on in a project, it\u2019s often\nhelpful to be able to poke around inside these exported variables.\nThat\u2019s what the exports viewer allows you to do.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image4\" src=\"../_images/d0212a9e.png\" /></p>\n<p>The figure above explains what the various parts of the interface do.\nThere\u2019s a popup list that lets you select which variable you want to\nview. To actually see it\u2019s contents after selecting it, you have to\nclick the \u201cEval\u201d button. The refresh button at the top left refreshes\nwhat you see in the heading of the panel. This might be necessary, for\nexample, after running the tile in which the selected export appears.\nNote that you might still need to click Eval to see the most current\ncontents of this export.</p>\n<p>The text box in the heading allows you to further specify how the\nvariable is evluated. For example, the export shown in the figure is a\nlist with 301 elements. But we might only need to see the first element\nof the list to get a sense for what\u2019s there. So we can type a \u201ctail\u201d\ninto the next box, just like you might type after the name of the\nvariable in Python code. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve done in the figure.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n", "alabaster_version": "0.7.10", "display_toc": true, "title": "The Main Interface", "sourcename": "Main-interface.rst.txt", "customsidebar": null, "metatags": "", "current_page_name": "Main-interface", "next": {"link": "../Log-And-Notebook/", "title": "The Log and Notebook"}, "rellinks": [["genindex", "General Index", "I", "index"], ["Log-And-Notebook", "The Log and Notebook", "N", "next"], ["Uploading-Data", "Uploading Data", "P", "previous"]], "meta": {}, "parents": [], "sidebars": ["about.html", "navigation.html", "relations.html", "searchbox.html", "donate.html"], "toc": "<ul>\n<li><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#\">The Main Interface</a><ul>\n<li><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#the-top-parts\">The top parts</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#working-with-tiles\">Working with tiles</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#the-log-in-brief\">The Log in brief</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#the-exports-viewer\">The Exports Viewer</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n", "prev": {"link": "../Uploading-Data/", "title": "Uploading Data"}, "page_source_suffix": ".rst"}
