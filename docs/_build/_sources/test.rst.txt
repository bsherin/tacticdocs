Getting Started
===============

Creating an account
------------------------------

First, you need an account. Right now the only way to get an account is to email
me, Bruce Sherin, at bsherin@northwestern.edu. In response, you'll get a username
and password.

Then head over to https://tactic.northwestern.edu and use your credentials to log in.
After you do, you can click on your account name at the top right of your browser window
to edit your profile and change your password.

First steps with collections
----------------------------

After you log in, you'll be taken automatically to Library manager. To get started using tactic, you need to load in some
data. Your libary should already have some collections loaded. To view
one of these collections, select it in the list and choose
:guilabel:`open` from the Open menu. (You can also double_click directly on the item or press the space bar or enter key.) A new pane
should appear showing your collection.
